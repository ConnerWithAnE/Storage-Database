# Storage-Database

A WIP system intended for use in a storage room. Allows for entry and searching of stored items.

The items are placed in boxes and then logged in the system, when the item is needed simply search for the item and remove it (remove WIP).

When returning an item, simply add it back to any box and the system will keep track of where everything is.
